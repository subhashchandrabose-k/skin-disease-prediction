We generally use Machine Learning Algorithms like Classification, Regression, knn, svm etc for our Daily use cases. But there are advanced techniques to improve our models like Ensembling methods. Here is an implementation of those advanced algorithms applied with hyperparameter tuning which helped us improve our model.
